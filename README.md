Hi I have built this application using MERN stack.

#Backend-->

Here is a swagger documnetation for better undersating of api endpints -> https://reachhub-l2zo.onrender.com/api-docs/
Might take few seconds to start as it is deployed on render.

Security Measures --> 
1. Validation has been applied i.e if a existing users tries to signup, it will show user already in use or email/password is incorrect it will show inavlid credentials.
2. Bcrypt has been used to protect password.
